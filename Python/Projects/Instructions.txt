INSTRUCTIONS
============
The aim of MineSweeper is to determine the locations of 25 bombs, randomly placed in a 20x20 grid.
On each go, you type in the coordinates of a square, e.g. E4.
If there is a bomb in that square, you lose. Otherwise, the number of bombs directly surrounding that square, including diagonally, will appear in that square.
If that number is a 0, the squares around it will be 'opened' automatically, as there cannot be any bombs there, to save you time.
If you think you know the position of a bomb, type 'M' followed by the coordinates of that square, e.g. ME4.
You win by 'opening' all of the squares except those with bombs in.
NB: It is luck on the first move, and you may get to a stage where it is luck later in the game too.
Good luck!
