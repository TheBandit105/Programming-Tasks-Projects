This code takes a value of n and prints the total or sum of the all the 'sum + i * i' (means sum add i multiplied by i) from 0 to the value of n in a for loop, increasing i by 1 each iteration. Each operation in this code takes a constant time. Say if each operation takes c time. The time taken for the lines of code to executed will depend on what value of n is inputted by the user. In the worst case, the value of n is so big that the code simply does not have enough memory space to carry out this many iterations and causes the program to crash or give an apparent result of 0. In the best case, the value of n is close to 0 that the finished code is executed within a few nanoseconds. This means that the bigger the value of n, the longer the code will take to execute and give a result.


Note: I know that the task doesn't ask you to run the code given, but I only ran the code to make sure that I understood what the code was running. Also, this code will not not compile unless you add #include <stdlib.h> to the code.
