For the 'for' loop between the iterations 1 - 10000, the time taken for the calculation decreased between 1 and 10 iterations, then steadily increased between 100 - 10000 iterations. In recursive, the time taken for the calculation initially stayed at 1000 ns between 1 and 10 iterations, but then rapidly increased between 100 - 10000 iterations. Finally, for the string comparison, the time taken for the strcmp function to be executed fluctuates between 1 - 10000 iterations.
